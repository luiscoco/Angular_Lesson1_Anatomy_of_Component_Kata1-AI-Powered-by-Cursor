  Kata 1 - Artifact 2: A template with no class
  
  This is just an HTML template file - NOT an Angular component.
  It has no associated TypeScript class, no @Component decorator, and no selector.
  
  REFLECTION: Why can't Angular use this as a component?
  Templates alone don't provide the logic/state management capabilities that components need.
  Angular needs a class to bind data to, handle events, and manage component lifecycle.
  A template is just static HTML without the component class to make it dynamic.

<div class="template-only">
  <h2>Template Only Content</h2>
  <p>This is just HTML - no component class!</p>
  <p>There's no way to bind data or handle events here.</p>
</div>
